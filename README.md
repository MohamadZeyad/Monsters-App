This app was built by working-along with a tutorial video.

By creating this project, I have learnd the necessary basics of using React-App like:

1) Using Class and Functional components.
2) Using props to communicate between components.
3) Having a state at the top of the App that on change will re-render the parts of the view that have changed.
4) Create Great file architechture.
5) Breaking down funcionality into single components that each can do one thing only, which will make my components more usable throughout my app.
